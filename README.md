# Machine-Learning-Modules
This repository contains my Machine Learning practice projects and source codes built while learning ML concepts. It includes implementations of key algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. Missing topics will be added soon.
Order of ml Models:-
Linear Regression
1) SLR on load_diabetes from sklearn.datasets
2) SLR on height-weight
